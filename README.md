# The-Snake-Game
This Python script implements the classic Snake game using Turtle graphics. Players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the screen edges. Features include score tracking, increasing difficulty as the snake grows, and a responsive game-over screen.
