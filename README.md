# The-Snake-Game
This Python script implements the classic Snake game using Turtle graphics. Players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the screen edges. Features include score tracking, increasing difficulty as the snake grows, and a responsive game-over screen.

Here's a detailed description of the Snake game implemented in Python using Turtle graphics:

Detailed Description of Snake Game

Imports and Initialization:
Imports: Imports necessary modules (Screen, S_game, Scoreboard, Food) from respective Python files.
Screen Setup: Creates a Screen object (my_screen) with the following configurations:
              Screen size set to 600 pixels width and height (setup(600,600)).
              Background color set to black (bgcolor("black")).
              Window title set to "The S game" (title("The S game")).
              Disables automatic updates (tracer(0)) to manually control screen updates.
Game Objects Initialization:
Snake: Initializes a snake (s_game) using the S_game class, which handles snake movement and interactions.
Food: Initializes food (food) using the Food class, which the snake eats to grow and increase score.
Scoreboard: Initializes a scoreboard (scoreboard) using the Scoreboard class to track and display the player's score.

Keyboard Controls:
Key Binding: Sets up keyboard bindings using my_screen.listen() and binds arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to corresponding methods (s_game.up(), s_game.down(), s_game.left(), s_game.right()) for snake movement.

Game Loop Execution:
Main Loop: Uses a while loop (while game_on) to continuously update the game state:
Updates the screen to reflect changes (my_screen.update()).
Introduces a delay (time.sleep(0.3)) to control the speed of snake movement.
Moves the snake (s_game.move_s()) based on current direction.

Collision Detection:
Food Collision: Checks if the snake's head (s_game.head) collides with the food (food) using s_game.head.distance(food) < 25. If true:
Refreshes the food's position (food.refresh()).
Increases the player's score using scoreboard.increase_score().

Game Termination:
Exit on Click: Waits for the user to click anywhere on the screen (my_screen.exitonclick()) to exit the game.
